Here's how you can analyze price trends and vendor-specific pricing in R, incorporating the uploaded dataset into a Quarto document:

Price Trends Visualization

Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†Å
#| label: fig-price-trends
#| fig-cap: Price trends over time for products
#| echo: false

# Load the dataset
analysis_data <- read_csv("path/to/analysis_data.csv")

# Convert `nowtime` to a date-time object
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = ymd_hms(nowtime))

# Plot price trends

  labs(x = "Vendor", y = "Current Price",
       title = "Pricing Distribution by Vendor") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Descriptive Text
For the price trends, the visualization will highlight how prices have changed over time, potentially revealing seasonal patterns or promotions. Each line in the graph represents a vendor, making it easier to compare their pricing strategies.

For pricing by vendor, the box plot illustrates the variability in prices for each vendor. This could indicate whether certain vendors consistently price higher or offer more uniform pricing across their products.

Would you like assistance adding more details or customizing these visualizations?

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Descriptive Text
This visualization tracks how current prices vary over time for each vendor. Key takeaways include:

Trend Analysis: Identify vendors with consistent pricing versus those that change frequently.
Seasonality or Promotions: Look for recurring patterns, such as price drops during specific periods, suggesting promotions or sales.
Vendor Comparison: Analyze which vendors maintain higher average prices over time and which are more volatile.
Would you like to add any filters, such as focusing on specific vendors or a particular time range?

To compare the Bayesian regression model with a linear regression model, we will fit a traditional linear model (lm) to the same data and compare the models' summaries, predictions, and visualizations. Here's how the comparison can be done:

Fitting a Linear Regression Model

Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†Å
#### Fit a Linear Regression Model ####
linear_model <- lm(current_price ~ price_per_unit + old_price, data = analysis_data)

  mutate(predicted_price_linear = predict(linear_model, newdata = analysis_data))

Key Observations
Bayesian Model Advantages:

Regularization may reduce overfitting, especially in small datasets.
Provides credible intervals for predictions, quantifying uncertainty.
Linear Model Advantages:

Simpler to compute and faster to train.
More interpretable when no priors are necessary.
RMSE and Visual Comparison:

If the Bayesian model has a lower RMSE and predictions align better with actual prices, it is preferred.
If both models perform similarly, the simpler linear regression may suffice unless prior knowledge is essential.

 why the generated graph for bay model and linear model is the same?
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
ChatGPT
The generated graphs for the Bayesian model and the linear model might look similar because the Bayesian regression model you are using has weakly informative priors that do not substantially differ from the assumptions of the traditional linear regression model in this case. Here‚Äôs why this might happen:

Reasons for Similar Graphs
Weak or Non-Informative Priors in Bayesian Model:

If the priors (normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)) used in the Bayesian model are weakly informative, the Bayesian model behaves similarly to the traditional frequentist linear regression model when the data is sufficient to dominate the posterior distribution.
The predictions (predict(bayesian_model, ...)) will then align closely with those of the linear regression model.
Linearity of the Model:

Both models are based on the same linear relationship between predictors and the outcome (current_price ~ price_per_unit + old_price). If the data fits the linear assumptions well, the models will generate nearly identical predictions.
Sufficient Data Size:

When the dataset has a large number of observations, the influence of priors in the Bayesian model diminishes, and the posterior distribution converges towards the likelihood. This makes the Bayesian predictions almost identical to those of the linear model.
Lack of Variability in Priors:

If the priors in the Bayesian model do not add substantial prior knowledge or constraints, they won't deviate the predictions significantly from the data-driven approach of the linear regression model.
How to Differentiate the Models
If you'd like to observe differences between the two models, consider the following strategies:

Modify the Priors:

Use more informative priors in the Bayesian model. For example, if you have prior knowledge that the coefficients should lie within a specific range, set the priors accordingly:
{r}
Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†Å
prior = normal(location = 1, scale = 1)
Smaller Dataset:

Reduce the size of the dataset. With less data, the Bayesian model will rely more on its priors, potentially leading to different predictions compared to the linear model.
Check Posterior Distributions:

Plot the posterior distributions of the Bayesian model parameters to observe the uncertainty around them:
{r}
Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†Å
plot(bayesian_model, plotfun = "mcmc")
Compare Predictive Intervals:

Bayesian models provide credible intervals for predictions, whereas linear models provide confidence intervals. Visualize these intervals to observe differences:
{r}
Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†Å
bayesian_intervals <- posterior_predict(bayesian_model, draws = 1000)
Use the intervals to create ribbon plots or overlay uncertainty in predictions.
Assess Residuals:

Compare the residual distributions for both models. Differences in how the models handle outliers or variability can be evident in the residual plots.
Simulate Data with Noise or Outliers:

Introduce some non-linearities, noise, or outliers into the dataset. Bayesian models with regularization (via priors) often handle these better than linear models.
If you'd like, I can modify the priors, simulate smaller datasets, or generate additional plots to highlight these differences further. Let me know!

To highlight differences between the Bayesian model and the linear regression model, we will:

Simulate a smaller dataset to emphasize the role of priors.
Compare residuals and credible/confidence intervals between the models.

Key Outcomes
Visualization Differences:

Modified priors in the Bayesian model lead to tighter credible intervals or systematic shifts in predictions.
Smaller datasets increase the influence of priors, differentiating Bayesian predictions from linear regression.
Uncertainty Representation:

Bayesian credible intervals provide a richer depiction of uncertainty compared to traditional confidence intervals.
Residual Analysis:

Bayesian models may show more robust handling of outliers or non-linear trends if present in the data.

RMSE for Bayesian Model: 2.538551 
RMSE for Linear Model: 2.515667
ChatGPT ËØ¥Ôºö
ChatGPT
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for both the Bayesian and Linear models are quite close:

Bayesian Model RMSE: 2.538551
Linear Model RMSE: 2.515667
Interpretation
Close Performance:

The nearly identical RMSE values suggest that both models perform similarly in predicting current_price in this context.
This similarity likely stems from the weak priors used in the Bayesian model and the linear nature of the relationship in the data.
Bayesian Model Specifics:

Bayesian models may not show clear improvement in RMSE if the priors are weakly informative and the dataset is large or representative of the population.
However, the Bayesian model might provide better interpretability through posterior distributions and credible intervals, which offer insight into the uncertainty of the predictions.
Linear Model Specifics:

The linear model often performs well with sufficient data and linear relationships. Its slightly lower RMSE suggests it may be slightly better tuned to this dataset under the assumption of minimizing prediction error alone.
Why Bayesian RMSE is Higher?
Incorporation of Priors:
If the priors deviate from the observed data trends, even slightly, they can influence the predictions, leading to slightly higher RMSE.
Uncertainty Handling:
Bayesian models inherently manage uncertainty, and this could result in slightly more conservative predictions, which might not minimize RMSE as aggressively as a frequentist approach.
